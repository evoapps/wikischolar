There are many different ways that one article can exhibit monotonic growth in its lifespan.

```{r config}
library(wikischolarlib)
data("featured1000")

# Find most linear article
linear <- lmer(quality ~ age + (age|title), data = featured1000)
linear_coefs <- tidy(linear) %>% filter(param == "age") %>% arrange(estimate)

# Find most and least quadratic
quad <- lmer(quality ~ age + age_sqr + (age + age_sqr|title), data = featured1000)
quad_coefs <- tidy(quad) %>% filter(param == "age_sqr")
most_coefs <- quad_coefs %>% arrange(desc(age_sqr))
least_coefs <- quad_coefs %>% arrange(age_sqr)
```
